# Deploy grok-box (use the box)

This is the plan for **actually running** a grok-box guest and talking to it from a laptop. It matches this repo as of the `docker-compose.yml` / `docker/Dockerfile` in tree. It does **not** provision anything for you.

**Repo of record:** [https://github.com/hexuria/box](https://github.com/hexuria/box) (`main`).

**First test (do this):** one **Akamai Cloud** VM (this is **Linode**, not Vultr), **guest Compose only**, **private access** (SSH tunnel or Tailscale). Drive it with the `grok-box` CLI / SDKs from your laptop. Do **not** open ports **1337 / 1340 / 6080** on the public internet.

Vultr is a different company and a different API. Tokens, Terraform providers, and regions do not transfer.

---

## A. What you are deploying

The **product** is:

- the guest Docker image (`grok-box:local` in Compose — there is **no** published registry image in this repo)
- `box-exec` + `box-host` inside that image
- the connect-only `grok-box` CLI and TypeScript / Python / Rust SDKs

You start the container. Then you call `connect(execUrl, hostUrl, token)`. There is **no** `Sandbox.create()` / docker-run helper in the SDKs.

[`ensurebox/`](../ensurebox/) (port **43142**) and [`l1/`](../l1/) (port **43141**) are **demos**. They are not a production control plane. L1 never holds `BOX_TOKEN` and never talks to the guest; it talks only to EnsureBox.

| Path | What runs on the VM | Who talks to the guest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 — recommended** | Guest only (`docker compose up`) | Your laptop: CLI / SDK |
| **2 — optional, later** | Guest **or** EnsureBox-spawned guests, plus demo UIs behind TLS | Browser → L1 → EnsureBox → guest. Still a demo. |

Production consumers are CLI/SDK against the guest HTTP wire (`:1337` exec, `:1340` host), not L1/L2.

### What the guest actually is

One **unprivileged** container (user `box`, **uid 1000**). Not privileged. No extra capabilities. **No** `docker.sock`. Chromium is started with `--no-sandbox` because it is not root.

Inside (see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)):

- `box-exec` on **1337** (exec, files, CUA)
- `box-host` on **1340** (health, ready, info, desktop/chrome)
- Xvfb **1280×800**, openbox, x11vnc (localhost **5900**), noVNC **6080**
- Chromium; CDP on **127.0.0.1:9222** only — **never publish 9222 or 5900**

Compose publishes **1337, 1340, 6080** as `1337:1337` (that is **0.0.0.0** on the VM). Healthcheck: `curl http://127.0.0.1:1340/v1/ready` (start period 25s, 5s interval, 12 retries). `shm_size` is **256mb**. Bind mounts: `./workspace-data:/workspace`, `./chrome-profile:/home/box/chrome-profile`.

`BOX_CORS_ORIGINS` is an explicit allowlist (`*` is ignored). Compose does **not** currently pass that env into the container; laptop CLI/SDK does not need CORS. Leave it unset unless a **browser** will call the guest directly (unusual — L1 talks to EnsureBox, not to 1337).

---

## B. What we need from you (checklist)

Reply with values. **Do not paste an Akamai API token into chat.** Keep it in a password manager, or in your shell as `LINODE_TOKEN` when **you** run OpenTofu later.

### Akamai Cloud (Linode) — first test

Create the token yourself:

1. Log in to [Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/).
2. Username (top right) → **API Tokens** ([direct](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens)).
3. **Create a Personal Access Token**. Label it e.g. `grok-box-test`. Expiry: short (a week) is enough for a test.
4. Scopes: Read/Write on **Linodes**, **Firewalls** (Cloud Firewalls often need `firewall:read_write` plus account access — if the UI is unclear, “Select All Read/Write” for a short-lived test token is acceptable). You do **not** need Object Storage / LKE for path 1.
5. Copy it once; Cloud Manager will not show it again. Never commit it.

OpenTofu / Terraform reads **`LINODE_TOKEN`** (Linode APIv4). Do not put the token in `.tf` / `.tfvars`.

```bash
export LINODE_TOKEN="…"   # your machine only
```

| # | Item | Your answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Akamai API token | Created (yes/no). **Kept local** — you run tofu, or we use a secret store later. |
| 2 | Region | Pick one. Closest defaults from the Philippines: **`ap-south`** (Singapore) or **`sg-sin-2`** (Singapore 2), then **`jp-tyo-3`** / **`ap-northeast`** (Tokyo). US/EU only if you want that latency on purpose (`us-ord` Chicago, `us-east` Newark, `eu-west` London). Confirm the slug in Cloud Manager before create. |
| 3 | SSH public key | Paste the **public** key (`ssh-ed25519 …` or `ssh-rsa …`). |
| 4 | Shape | **Guest-only (path 1)** or **guest + demo UIs (path 2)** |
| 5 | DNS | Domain name **or** “IP only for the test” (IP-only is right for the first private test) |
| 6 | `BOX_TOKEN` | Generate a strong one for you **or** you supply one. Never use `dev-box-token` on a VM. |
| 7 | CORS origins | Almost always **none**. Only if a browser will call the guest. |
| 8 | Size / budget | Confirm the size in [§C](#c-instance--machine-sizing) (recommended: **Linode 8 GB Shared**, ~**$48/mo** / **$0.072/hr**, delete when done). |

Optional later: a domain + DNS at Akamai or elsewhere (only for public HTTPS). Tailscale account if you prefer overlay VPN over SSH tunnels.

---

## C. Instance / machine sizing

This guest is **RAM-heavy**: Debian + Xvfb + openbox + Chromium + two Rust daemons. The **first** deploy also **builds the image on the VM** (Rust `1.85` builder compiles `box-exec` / `box-host`, then a `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime with Chromium). There is no GHCR/ECR image in this repo today.

| Plan | Type slug | vCPU | RAM | Disk | ~price (core regions, 2026 list — confirm in Cloud Manager) | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nanode 1 GB | `g6-nanode-1` | 1 | 1 GB | 25 GB | ~$5/mo | No. |
| Linode 2 GB | `g6-standard-1` | 1 | 2 GB | 50 GB | ~$12/mo | No. Chromium will thrash. |
| Linode 4 GB | `g6-standard-2` | 2 | 4 GB | 80 GB | ~$24/mo | Runtime **maybe** after a prebuilt image. **First `docker compose up --build` will likely OOM.** |
| **Linode 8 GB Shared** | **`g6-standard-4`** | **4** | **8 GB** | **160 GB** | **~$48/mo, ~$0.072/hr** | **Yes — first Akamai test.** |
| Dedicated 8 GB | `g6-dedicated-4` | 4 | 8 GB | 160 GB | ~$72/mo | If you want no noisy neighbor. Same RAM. Not required for a Saturday test. |

**Image slug:** `linode/ubuntu24.04` (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS).

**Swap is a last resort, not a plan.** Do not size a 4 GB box and “add 8 GB swap” so Chromium and `cargo` can page. If the build OOMs on 8 GB (unlucky), resize up to **Linode 16 GB** (`g6-standard-6`) for the build, then you can resize down for idle runtime.

**Disk:** 160 GB is plenty: Docker builder layers (Rust image is large), Chromium in the runtime, Compose volumes, a bit of workspace. The bind mounts are your data; the image layers are disposable.

**Runtime-only later** (pull a prebuilt image, no compiler): **4 GB** can work for one desktop guest. Still skip 2 GB.

**Exec/files only** (`BOX_DESKTOP=0`, `BOX_DESKTOP_REQUIRED=0`, no Chromium): RAM drops a lot. Still do not use a Nanode for the first build.

---

## D. Networking and TLS (critical)

### Ports (verify against Compose)

| Port | Publish? | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1337** | Compose yes (`0.0.0.0`) | `box-exec` — Bearer `BOX_TOKEN` except `GET /v1/health` |
| **1340** | Compose yes | `box-host` — Bearer except `GET /v1/health` and `GET /v1/ready` |
| **6080** | Compose yes | noVNC `/vnc.html` — **not** Bearer; VNC password is **first 8 characters of `BOX_TOKEN`** (or `BOX_VNC_PASSWORD`) |
| 5900 | **no** | x11vnc, `127.0.0.1` inside the container |
| 9222 | **no** | Chromium CDP, `127.0.0.1` only |

`BOX_TOKEN` is bearer auth. It is **not** a substitute for TLS. Do **not** expose exec/host as raw HTTP on a public IP.

Health and ready are **unauthenticated**. If those ports are on the internet, anyone can fingerprint the box even without the token.

noVNC is a **full desktop session** (keyboard/mouse on 1280×800). Treat **6080** like a KVM. The VNC password is truncated to **8 chars** (x11vnc). A strong `BOX_TOKEN` does **not** give you a strong VNC password unless you set a dedicated `BOX_VNC_PASSWORD` (still 8 chars effective). Another reason to keep 6080 off the public internet.

### Two network modes

**1. Private (first test — do this)**

- One VM. Cloud Firewall **default-deny** inbound. Allow **TCP 22** only (optionally from your home IP `/32`). IPv6: same policy (`DROP` unless you allow SSH on v6).
- Do **not** allow 1337, 1340, 6080, 5900, 9222 on the public firewall.
- Reach the guest from the laptop by **either**:
  - **SSH tunnel** (simplest, no extra accounts):

    ```bash
    ssh -N \
      -L 1337:127.0.0.1:1337 \
      -L 1340:127.0.0.1:1340 \
      -L 6080:127.0.0.1:6080 \
      root@VM_IPV4
    ```

    CLI uses `http://127.0.0.1:1337` and `http://127.0.0.1:1340`.
  - **Tailscale** (or WireGuard): install on the VM + laptop. Point the CLI at `http://<tailscale-100.x>:1337`. Cloud Firewall still blocks the **public** NIC. Tailscale may fall back to DERP if UDP **41641** is not open — that is fine for a test.

Compose publishes `0.0.0.0`. **Firewall is mandatory** even for a “private” test: Akamai gives the VM a **public IPv4** (and usually IPv6). Binding Compose to loopback is extra defense:

```yaml
# compose override — private test
services:
  box:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:1337:1337"
      - "127.0.0.1:1340:1340"
      - "127.0.0.1:6080:6080"
```

Loopback bind + SSH tunnel is the tightest combo. Loopback bind **breaks** “dial the Tailscale IP :1337” (Tailscale is not `127.0.0.1`); use the tunnel over Tailscale SSH instead.

**2. Public HTTPS (only after the private test works)**

- Domain → **Caddy** or nginx on the VM → `127.0.0.1:1337` / `:1340` / (optional) `:6080`.
- Let’s Encrypt on **443**. Firewall: **22 + 443** only. Still send `Authorization: Bearer`.
- Subdomains are simpler than path prefixes (the client appends `/v1/...` to the base URL):

```caddy
exec.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:1337
}
host.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:1340
}
# optional; still sensitive
desktop.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:6080
}
```

Then:

```bash
export GROK_BOX_EXEC_URL=https://exec.example.com
export GROK_BOX_HOST_URL=https://host.example.com
export GROK_BOX_TOKEN='…'
```

IP-only HTTP on `:1337` is not an acceptable “public” mode.

### Firewall philosophy

Default-deny. SSH keys, not passwords. Unattended-upgrades on Ubuntu. Cloud Firewalls on Akamai are **free** and sit in front of the VM ([docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/cloud-firewall)). Still keep `ufw` or nftables if you want defense in depth; the Cloud Firewall is the one that matters when Docker publishes `0.0.0.0`.

---

## E. Multiple deployment methods

Simplest → more infra. Same guest, same Compose, same firewall idea everywhere.

Akamai Cloud Compute **is** Linode. The OpenTofu/Terraform provider for **VMs** is **`linode/linode`**, token **`LINODE_TOKEN`**. The **`akamai/akamai`** provider is CDN / Property Manager / edge — **not** this VM. Do not mix them.

### 1. Manual VM + Docker Compose (start here)

**When:** Saturday afternoon, path 1, you want a box you can SSH into and poke.

**Akamai Cloud Manager**

1. Create → Linode. Image **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (`linode/ubuntu24.04`). Type **Linode 8 GB** (`g6-standard-4`). Region from the checklist. SSH key, **no** password login if the UI allows key-only (or set a throwaway root password and disable password SSH after).
2. Create a **Cloud Firewall**: inbound **DROP**, allow TCP **22**. Attach it to the Linode. Allow IPv6 SSH only if you will use v6; otherwise drop v6 inbound too.
3. SSH in. Install Docker Engine + Compose plugin (Ubuntu 24.04):

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl git
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
   # log out and back in so docker works without sudo
   ```

4. Clone and run (**builds on the VM** — first time is slow, 10–30+ minutes):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hexuria/box.git
   cd box
   umask 077
   openssl rand -base64 32 > /tmp/box-token
   cat > .env <<EOF
   BOX_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/box-token)
   BOX_ID=akamai-test
   BOX_DESKTOP=1
   BOX_DESKTOP_REQUIRED=1
   RUST_LOG=info
   EOF
   chmod 600 .env
   shred -u /tmp/box-token
   mkdir -p workspace-data chrome-profile
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 workspace-data chrome-profile
   docker compose up --build -d
   docker compose ps
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:1340/v1/ready
   ```

   If the GitHub repo is private, use a deploy key or `scp` the tree instead of a plaintext PAT in `git clone`.

5. From the **laptop**, open the SSH tunnel ([§D](#d-networking-and-tls-critical)) and follow [§F](#f-day-1-use-it-flow).

**Pros:** Obvious, debuggable, matches local README. **Cons:** Click-ops, easy to forget the firewall, first build is heavy.

There is **no** public `grok-box` image in this repository. `image: grok-box:local` is local-only. First test **builds on the VM**.

### 2. Cloud-init / StackScript / user-data

**When:** you will create/destroy this VM more than once, still without OpenTofu.

Akamai: Metadata **user-data** (cloud-init) on images that support it, **or** a [StackScript](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/stackscripts). Akamai’s own docs now prefer Metadata/cloud-init for new work; StackScripts do not run in **distributed** compute regions. Same script works as AWS user-data, GCP startup-script, Azure custom-data.

**Do not put `BOX_TOKEN` or `LINODE_TOKEN` in user-data.** cloud-init logs are world-readable on the instance.

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_update: true
packages:
  - git
  - ca-certificates
  - curl
ssh_pwauth: false
runcmd:
  - curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
  - git clone https://github.com/hexuria/box.git /opt/grok-box
  - mkdir -p /opt/grok-box/workspace-data /opt/grok-box/chrome-profile
  - chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/grok-box/workspace-data /opt/grok-box/chrome-profile
  - |
      echo "Clone done. SSH in, write /opt/grok-box/.env with BOX_TOKEN, then:"
      echo "  cd /opt/grok-box && docker compose up --build -d"
```

Pass this as Metadata `user_data` (API wants **base64**). Then SSH, write `.env`, compose up. Unattended “clone + compose up” is possible if you inject the token via a secret mount later; do not bake it into the StackScript body (visible via API).

**Pros:** Repeatable create. **Cons:** First boot still compiles; secrets handling is easy to get wrong.

### 3. OpenTofu (preferred) or Terraform

**When:** after the manual VM works, so you can recreate/destroy cleanly. **Do not start here** for the first “does Chromium even fit” test.

**OpenTofu** is the OSS default. Terraform is equivalent for this (same HCL). Pin `linode/linode` v3 (`~> 3.0`). Auth: `export LINODE_TOKEN=…` on **your** machine. Local state is OK for a personal test (`terraform.tfstate` has IPs, not the Linode token if you used the env var — still do not commit state). Never put tokens in `*.tfvars` committed to git.

This pass does **not** ship a full module. Resource list for Akamai:

| Resource | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `linode_instance` | `image = "linode/ubuntu24.04"`, `type = "g6-standard-4"`, `region = var.region`, `authorized_keys = [var.ssh_public_key]`, `metadata { user_data = base64encode(file("cloud-init.yaml")) }`. Avoid `root_pass` if keys suffice. |
| `linode_firewall` | `inbound_policy = "DROP"`, `outbound_policy = "ACCEPT"`, allow TCP 22 (and 443 only if you later go public). Cover **ipv4 and ipv6**. Attach with `linodes = [linode_instance.box.id]` (or `linode_firewall_device`). |
| `linode_domain` / `linode_domain_record` | Optional, public HTTPS only. |
| Outputs | IPv4, IPv6, `ssh root@…`, suggested `-L` tunnel command. |

Sketch (not a maintained module — check [registry.terraform.io/providers/linode/linode](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/linode/linode/latest/docs) before apply):

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    linode = {
      source  = "linode/linode"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "linode" {} # LINODE_TOKEN

resource "linode_instance" "box" {
  label           = "grok-box-test"
  region          = var.region
  type            = "g6-standard-4"
  image           = "linode/ubuntu24.04"
  authorized_keys = [var.ssh_public_key]
  metadata {
    user_data = base64encode(file("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml"))
  }
}

resource "linode_firewall" "box" {
  label           = "grok-box-test"
  inbound_policy  = "DROP"
  outbound_policy = "ACCEPT"

  inbound {
    label    = "ssh"
    action   = "ACCEPT"
    protocol = "TCP"
    ports    = "22"
    ipv4     = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # better: ["YOUR.IP/32"]
    ipv6     = ["::/0"]
  }

  linodes = [linode_instance.box.id]
}

output "ipv4" { value = linode_instance.box.ip_address }
output "ssh" { value = "ssh root@${linode_instance.box.ip_address}" }
output "tunnel" {
  value = "ssh -N -L 1337:127.0.0.1:1337 -L 1340:127.0.0.1:1340 -L 6080:127.0.0.1:6080 root@${linode_instance.box.ip_address}"
}
```

**Other clouds — copy Compose + cloud-init, swap the VM resource:**

| Cloud | VM | Firewall | Image / bootstrap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AWS** | One **EC2** `t3.large` (2 vCPU / 8 GB) or `t3.xlarge` if the build is tight. No ALB for the first test. | **Security group**: 22 (your IP), later 443. Not 1337/1340/6080. | Ubuntu 24.04 AMI (Canonical). Same cloud-init as `user_data`. Provider `hashicorp/aws`. |
| **GCP** | One **Compute Engine** `e2-standard-2` (2 vCPU / 8 GB). | VPC firewall **tags**: `allow-ssh`, later `allow-https`. | `ubuntu-2404-lts`. `metadata.startup-script`. Provider `hashicorp/google`. |
| **Azure** | One VM **Standard_D2s_v5** or **Standard_B2ms** (~8 GB). | **NSG**: 22, later 443. | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Custom data = cloud-init. Provider `hashicorp/azurerm`. |

Caddy on the VM beats an ALB/HTTPS load balancer for a single box. Shared philosophy: one VM, Docker Compose, default-deny, private first.

**Pros:** Recreate/destroy is a command; cost stops when you `tofu destroy`. **Cons:** Provider quirks, state files, easy to commit secrets if you are sloppy.

### 4. Container-as-a-service? Kubernetes?

The guest is a **long-running** container with X11, VNC, and Chromium — not a 10ms serverless function.

| Platform | Fit |
| --- | --- |
| Lambda / Cloud Functions | No. |
| Cloud Run / App Service “scale to zero” | Poor. Need min instances, RAM, and **three** HTTP ports (or a sidecar proxy). WebSockets for noVNC are awkward. |
| ACI / ECS Fargate / Cloud Run **always-on** | Possible in theory: it is **one** container, not a Compose mesh. You still need ~8 GB, `shm`, persistent disks for `/workspace` + chrome profile, and TLS in front. More glue than a VM. |
| **VM + Compose** | **Do this first.** |
| Kubernetes | Later, if you already have a cluster: one Deployment, Service, two PVCs, `emptyDir` `medium: Memory` ~256Mi for `/dev/shm`, `runAsUser: 1000`, do not Service-expose 9222. Not the first test. |

EnsureBox is a **host Docker** orchestrator (it `docker run`s guests). It does not belong on Cloud Run.

### 5. Prebuilt image to a registry (second iteration)

Build on a beefy machine or CI, push to **GHCR** (Akamai has **no** first-class managed container registry like ECR — use GHCR, or ECR/GCR/ACR on those clouds). VM only `docker compose pull` / `docker run`.

Until that exists, `git clone && docker compose up --build` is the path.

---

## F. Day-1 “use it” flow

After the Akamai VM is up and Compose is healthy:

1. **Tunnel** from the laptop (or Tailscale). Confirm:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1/health
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:1340/v1/health
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:1340/v1/ready
   ```

   Ready is **200** when exec is up and (with `BOX_DESKTOP_REQUIRED=1`) Xvfb is up. Chrome is **not** on the ready path — give Chromium a few more seconds before screenshots look interesting.

2. **URLs + token** (private mode):

   - exec: `http://127.0.0.1:1337`
   - host: `http://127.0.0.1:1340`
   - token: `BOX_TOKEN` from the VM `.env` (copy it out over SSH; do not paste it into random chat logs)

   Do **not** use `GET /v1/info` `endpoints` as connect URLs. Those are container-local listen addresses.

3. **CLI from the laptop** (workspace crate; not published to crates.io):

   ```bash
   export GROK_BOX_EXEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1337
   export GROK_BOX_HOST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1340
   export GROK_BOX_TOKEN='…'   # same as BOX_TOKEN

   cargo run -p grok-box -- health
   cargo run -p grok-box -- ready
   cargo run -p grok-box -- exec -- echo ok
   cargo run -p grok-box -- files put hello.txt --content 'hi'
   cargo run -p grok-box -- files get hello.txt
   cargo run -p grok-box -- cua screenshot --png -o /tmp/box.png
   ```

   TypeScript / Python: `GrokBox.connect(execUrl, hostUrl, token)` — same three values. No docker helper.

4. **Optional noVNC:** [http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html](http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html) through the tunnel. Password = first **8** characters of `BOX_TOKEN` (unless `BOX_VNC_PASSWORD`).

**It works when:** `echo ok` returns exit 0, file put/get round-trips, screenshot writes a PNG of the 1280×800 desktop.

---

## G. Security and ops

- **Rotate `BOX_TOKEN`:** recreate the container with a new env value (`docker compose up -d --force-recreate`). Update the laptop env. Changing the token changes the default VNC password (first 8 chars) unless `BOX_VNC_PASSWORD` is set.
- **Do not log tokens.** Do not put them in Compose `docker compose config` pastebins, CI logs, or L1. Exec children already strip `BOX_TOKEN`, `BOX_HOST_TOKEN`, and `BOX_VNC_PASSWORD`.
- Guest **must not** leak `BOX_TOKEN` to L1. L1 smoke asserts the L1 source never mentions it.
- SSH **keys**, not passwords. `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`. `unattended-upgrades`.
- **Disk:** `workspace-data` is **your** files. `chrome-profile` is cookies/session for uid **1000**. Bind mounts created as root are not writable by `box` until `chown 1000:1000`. Back up the workspace volume if you care; the image is rebuildable.
- **Cost:** an idle VM still bills. Power off or `tofu destroy` / Cloud Manager delete when done. Hourly on 8 GB Shared is on the order of **seven cents**. A forgotten month is **~$48**.
- **CORS:** default is no browser origins. Do not point a random website at 1337.
- **CDP unpublished.** Do not add `9222:9222` to Compose.
- Path 2 demos: EnsureBox token (`ENSUREBOX_TOKEN`) is **not** `BOX_TOKEN`. npm scripts bind L1/EnsureBox to **127.0.0.1** — put Caddy on the same VM. EnsureBox needs **host Docker** (it `docker run`s guests). Its viewer URLs are hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:<novnc>/vnc.html`, so remote browsers need a tunnel or extra proxy work. Another reason path 2 is later.

## H. Suggested sequence for this week

1. You send the [checklist](#b-what-we-need-from-you-checklist). API token stays on your machine (you run tofu later) or in a secret store — **not chat**.
2. **First deploy:** one Akamai VM, Ubuntu 24.04, 8 GB Shared, Cloud Firewall 22 only, guest Compose only, private access (SSH tunnel).
3. Prove CLI/SDK from the laptop (exec, files, screenshot PNG).
4. Only then: public HTTPS (Caddy + domain) **or** demo UIs (EnsureBox/L1).
5. Only then: a small OpenTofu root so create/destroy is boring.
6. Other clouds: same Compose + cloud-init, swap the instance/firewall resources.

## I. Open questions / risks

- **Image build time on the VM.** First `docker compose up --build` compiles Rust in `rust:1.85-bookworm` and apt-installs Chromium. Expect a long first boot. A small VM makes this worse; 8 GB / 4 vCPU is the mitigation.
- **Chromium RAM.** One desktop guest is the design point. Two guests on one 8 GB VM (EnsureBox spawning extras) will hurt.
- **IPv6.** Akamai assigns it. Cloud Firewall must DROP v6 too, or you published the box on v6 while locking v4.
- **Compose publishes `0.0.0.0`.** Public IP + no Cloud Firewall = the world can hit 1337/1340/6080. Health is open; noVNC is a desktop. Firewall is not optional.
- **Desktop vs `BOX_DESKTOP=0`.** If you only need exec/files, turn desktop off (`BOX_DESKTOP=0`, `BOX_DESKTOP_REQUIRED=0`). Ready no longer waits on X. No screenshots, no noVNC. Less RAM. Compose still lists 6080 unless you override ports.
- **Volume ownership.** uid **1000** must own bind mounts.
- **No registry.** First test builds from git. Plan a GHCR push before you scale to many VMs.
- **EnsureBox ≠ Compose guest.** Path 2’s demo orchestrator starts **its own** containers from `GROK_BOX_IMAGE=grok-box:local`. You do not need both a long-lived root Compose stack **and** EnsureBox unless you are deliberately running two different guests.
- **Provider confusion.** Compute = `linode/linode` + `LINODE_TOKEN`. Not Vultr. Not `akamai/akamai`.
