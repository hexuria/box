//! stall clicks. The async `ACTUATOR` mutex in `lib.rs` still serializes
//! pointer gestures (click gap, drag grab); it is never held across
//! screenshot work.
//!
//! Both paths are blocking X11 round-trips, so both run on `spawn_blocking`
//! rather than on a tokio worker. Input additionally carries a deadline:
//! x11rb has no reply deadline of its own, and input runs while `lib.rs`
//! holds `ACTUATOR`, so a wedged or paused X server would otherwise park a
//! worker for as long as the server stays quiet and leave every later CUA
//! request queued behind a lock that is never released.
