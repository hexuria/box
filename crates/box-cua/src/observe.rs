//! What the box saw around a recipe step.
//!
//! `ok` on a receipt means "no step returned an error", and that is the only
//! thing it has ever meant. A recipe whose fixed coordinates have drifted
//! onto a different window plays every step without error and achieves
//! nothing, so the caller deciding whether to run it again could not tell a
//! run that worked from a run that did not. `ok` is left exactly as it was —
//! a cleverer boolean would make the box guess at what a recipe was *for*,
//! and a confident wrong guess is how that incident started. Instead the
//! receipt carries what the box actually saw, and the judgement stays with
//! whoever asked.
//!
//! Three facts, none of them a verdict:
//!
//! - **`target`** — the window covering the coordinate a pointer step aims
//!   at, read before the step moves anything. A taped click that lands on a
//!   different window than last time is visible here.
//! - **`focus`** — where a keystroke sent right now would go. `state: "none"`
//!   is a `type` that reached nothing at all.
//! - **`url_before` / `url_after`** — the page Chromium was showing either
//!   side of the step, so a `Return` that submitted nothing shows up as a
//!   URL that did not move.
//!
//! None of it is on by default. `observe: "off"` produces the receipt this
//! endpoint produced before the field existed, byte for byte.
